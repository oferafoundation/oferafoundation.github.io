"<p>Since his introduction to global warming in fourth grade, Oliver, a fourth year at Arcadia high, has lost countless hours of sleep worrying for the penguins and polar bears of Antarctica saw in Planet Earth documentaries. Though he had yet to watch Planet Earth II, he intends to see those beautiful animals not in zoos and nor commentated on by David Attenborough, but in nature in all their glory. He hopes to see through with The Ofera Foundation’s success in his community, and with an impact on a much wider scale. In the future, Oliver intends to visit all 50 states with friends and learn how to fly a plane.</p>",

"<p>Seventeen-year old Arcadia High School senior Brian Theung at Arcadia High School has always marveled at the beautiful beaches and sweeping forests that come courtesy of living in Southern California. In recent years, however, decreased public support for environmental protection and a hostile political climate has allowed these wonders to be exploited and destroyed, devastating entire communities and families. By writing for The Ofera Foundation, he hopes to increase awareness about these issues and promote change in his community. While he is not sure what the future holds for him, he hopes to attend college and pursue a career in humanities.</p>",



"<p>Ysobelle Flores is a seventeen-year-old senior that will be attending Arcadia High this upcoming fall. After living in the Philippines for nine years, she has had the privilege to experience and take in the scenery and the environment that the once beautiful country had to offer. However, when she returned several years ago, it was not what she remembered it to be. The trees were slowly being chopped off, the beaches were covered by waste, and the rivers that once ran clear were inky brown. Through the Ofera Foundation, she hopes to change what society is doing to our environment one step at a time. Her future, she hopes, will be university majors in business and/or marketing.</p>",



"<p>John Song is a seventeen year-old senior at Arcadia High School. Growing up, his family would take trips all around the world every year and visit some of its great wonders. Reading about the negative impacts of climate change and other environmental issues made him remember the beautiful views that he was able to see and gave me the heart to protect our environment. Living in Southern California has sadly given John the opportunity to experience the negative impacts of climate change due to the steadily rising temperatures every summer. The summer of 2018 has brought record highs in temperature all across the Northern Hemisphere and he worried that these record will be broken again next year. By joining Ofera, John hopes to bring awareness to environmental issues that have been ignored by powerful figures and the EPA and contribute what little he can to help.</p>",

As a photographer who admires the many nature sites of the world, she has recently grown to understand that so many beauties would be taken away without mother nature.

In college, she is looking to pursue a psychology major to understand people more and influence the world for the better.</p>",

However, throughout these adventures she has seen the sad, slow but sure deterioration of our environment.

"<p>Hello! I'm Mikayla Hwee, a sixteen-going-on-seventeen year old senior at Arcadia High. Growing up in the city, I was quite sheltered from the environmental issues prevalent around the globe-- I never knew that the picturesque landscapes on postcards were slowly deteriorating because of the actions of humans. Through the expansion of online platforms and my participation in an AP Environmental Science course, I was exposed to the many environmental issues that have been neglected by the majority of the population. I hope that through Ofera, I will be able to further spread awareness and propose solutions to better the environment. I am still unsure about my own personal future, but as of now, I am looking towards pursuing a business major/career.</p>",



"<p>Hola!! My name is Megan Chao and I’m currently a 17 year old senior at Arcadia High School. During junior year, my eyes were opened as I became aware of the various problems that threaten our environment to this very day. Through the Environmental Science course offered at my school, I was able to learn how to tackle these threats within our community. With The Ofera Foundation, I wish to share and inform others about the situation the Earth is facing while encouraging solutions that will help everyone reach the goal of conserving the beautiful planet</p>",



"<p>Hello! I’m Cassidy Chhay, a fifteen-year-old sophomore at Arcadia High School. As a child that didn’t leave the house that much, through the internet, I was able to learn more about the world and how much it has changed over the years. As I grow older, I am learning more and more about it and how much we are hurting it I hope that OFERA brings awareness to our-- and future-- generations and make a difference. I am not completely sure what I want to do in the future, I do, however, do want there to be a green future to look forward too. </p>",
