    "<p>People donâ€™t think much about the pollution that has been seeping into the air from man-made causes such as factories or even natural causes such as rotting vegetation and erupting volcanoes. However, these issues are more pressing than they seem because air pollution contributes to acid rain.</p>",
    "<p>Acid rain is precipitation containing high levels of nitric and sulfuric acids. When acid rain falls into rivers, lakes, and oceans, it causes the bodies of water to absorb the aluminum that is in the soil around them. The water then becomes poisonous for sea life, killing fish, clams, and other aquatic animals. The deaths of these animals affect the rest of the food chain, such as birds who feed on the fish from rivers. </p>",
    "<p>The aluminum released from the soil after acid rain occurs rids the soil of essential nutrients and damages forests, especially those in high elevation. The aluminum makes it harder for trees to absorb water and the leaves are also harmed by the acid. Acid rain also cause trees and other plants to be unable to withstand colder temperatures. They are also more vulnerable to insects and disease.</p>",
    "<p>Much like smoke, the sulfuric and nitric acids in the air make it harder for humans to see as clearly as they could if the pollution was taken care of. Sulfate particles causes a 50 to 70 percent visibility reduction, affecting many of the national parks in regions such as the Shenandoah and the Great Smoky Mountains.</p>",
    "<p>While walking or swimming through acid rain water will not injure or kill anyone, consuming acid rain can cause brain damage over time. Acid rain looks, feels, and tastes just like clean water, making it very dangerous to both animals and humans alike. </p>",
    "<p>The only way to reduce this is to reduce the burning of fossil fuels in the air that cause air pollution. Everyone at home can also help by conserving energy, like cutting on the amount of electricity used. Vehicles use a lot of fossil fuels so people can also help by carpooling or biking or walking to local areas. </p>",
