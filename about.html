After living in the Philippines for nine years, she has had the privilege to experience and take in the scenery and the environment that the once beautiful country had to offer. However, when she returned several years ago, it was not what she remembered it to be. The trees were slowly being chopped off, the beaches were covered by waste, and the rivers that once ran clear were inky brown. Through the Ofera Foundation, she hopes to change what society is doing to our environment one step at a time. Her future, she hopes, will be university majors in business and/or marketing.</small></p>

Growing up in the city, I was quite sheltered from the environmental issues prevalent around the globe-- I never knew that the picturesque landscapes on postcards were slowly deteriorating because of the actions of humans. Through the expansion of online platforms and my participation in an AP Environmental Science course, I was exposed to the many environmental issues that have been neglected by the majority of the population. I hope that through Ofera, I will be able to further spread awareness and propose solutions to better the environment. I am still unsure about my own personal future, but as of now, I am looking towards pursuing a business major/career.</small></p>

With The Ofera Foundation, I wish to share and inform others about the situation the Earth is facing while encouraging solutions that will help everyone reach the goal of conserving the beautiful planet.</small></p>
