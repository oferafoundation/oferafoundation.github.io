    	<h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>Dorian is intrigued that Lord Henry might be a "very bad influence." Lord Henry responds prophetically with one of his aphorisms: "There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral" — that is, to influence someone is to alter his view of himself. In a key statement that echoes Wilde's personal philosophy, Lord Henry asserts, "The aim of life is self-develop-ment. To realize one's nature perfectly — that is what each of us is here for." He laments that humanity has lost courage, and he presents a monologue on courage, fear, living life fully, and the virtues of yielding to temptation.</p>

The trees were slowly being chopped off, the beaches were covered by waste, and the rivers that once ran clear were inky brown. Through the Ofera Foundation, she hopes to change what society is doing to our environment one step at a time. Her future, she hopes, will be university majors in business and/or marketing.</small></p>

Growing up, his family would take trips all around the world every year and visit some of its great wonders. Reading about the negative impacts of climate change and other environmental issues made him remember the beautiful views that he was able to see and gave me the heart to protect our environment. Living in Southern California has sadly given John the opportunity to experience the negative impacts of climate change due to the steadily rising temperatures every summer. The summer of 2018 has brought record highs in temperature all across the Northern Hemisphere and he worried that these record will be broken again next year. By joining Ofera, John hopes to bring awareness to environmental issues that have been ignored by powerful figures and the EPA and contribute what little he can to help.</small></p>

Growing up in the city, I was quite sheltered from the environmental issues prevalent around the globe-- I never knew that the picturesque landscapes on postcards were slowly deteriorating because of the actions of humans. Through the expansion of online platforms and my participation in an AP Environmental Science course, I was exposed to the many environmental issues that have been neglected by the majority of the population. I hope that through Ofera, I will be able to further spread awareness and propose solutions to better the environment. I am still unsure about my own personal future, but as of now, I am looking towards pursuing a business major/career.</small></p>
