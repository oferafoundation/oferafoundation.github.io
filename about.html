    	<h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>Dorian is intrigued that Lord Henry might be a "very bad influence." Lord Henry responds prophetically with one of his aphorisms: "There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral" — that is, to influence someone is to alter his view of himself. In a key statement that echoes Wilde's personal philosophy, Lord Henry asserts, "The aim of life is self-develop-ment. To realize one's nature perfectly — that is what each of us is here for." He laments that humanity has lost courage, and he presents a monologue on courage, fear, living life fully, and the virtues of yielding to temptation.</p>

In recent years, however, decreased public support for environmental protection and a hostile political climate has allowed these wonders to be exploited and destroyed, devastating entire communities and families. By writing for The Ofera Foundation, he hopes to increase awareness about these issues and promote change in his community. While he is not sure what the future holds for him, he hopes to attend college and pursue a career in humanities.</small></p>

After living in the Philippines for nine years, she has had the privilege to experience and take in the scenery and the environment that the once beautiful country had to offer. However, when she returned several years ago, it was not what she remembered it to be. The trees were slowly being chopped off, the beaches were covered by waste, and the rivers that once ran clear were inky brown. Through the Ofera Foundation, she hopes to change what society is doing to our environment one step at a time. Her future, she hopes, will be university majors in business and/or marketing.</small></p>

Growing up, his family would take trips all around the world every year and visit some of its great wonders. Reading about the negative impacts of climate change and other environmental issues made him remember the beautiful views that he was able to see and gave me the heart to protect our environment. Living in Southern California has sadly given John the opportunity to experience the negative impacts of climate change due to the steadily rising temperatures every summer. The summer of 2018 has brought record highs in temperature all across the Northern Hemisphere and he worried that these record will be broken again next year. By joining Ofera, John hopes to bring awareness to environmental issues that have been ignored by powerful figures and the EPA and contribute what little he can to help.</small></p>
